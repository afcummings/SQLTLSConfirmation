# SQLTLSConfirmation
This is a simple refresher project on C# and SQL based on work I had done previously.  SQL code is run to check if the TLS that was set up on local test servers was run succesfully.  If the backup date is greater than one day, a message is sent to the console that states the backup was not successful.
